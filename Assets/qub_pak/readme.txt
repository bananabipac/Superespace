Qub Pak is a collection of 6 square containers especially optimized for performance on old machines and mobile devices.
Each of the models has a 'near' (500 triangles) and 'far' (100 triangles) lod versions.
The way they ARE CREATED TO BE USED is without any lights (unlit/texture) in a bright environment, but just in case normal, specular and AO maps are also included.
 
the story:
In 1974 a small team of Soviet engineers, lead by Assery Obrenko and Oksana Kalinina, was assembled to design the containers and equipment for an Russian-American retrieval mission to the Moon. The team had 18 months to complete the task, while cosmonauts were in training. According to official sources, the mission was canceled in the last minute, but speculations still go on as to whether a secret Soyuz-Apollo mission took place. Nevertheless, the resulting containers greatly surpassed the requirements for durability in the extreme conditions on the Moon and showed perfect conservation of their cargo.
 Recently, the R&D department of our partner studio in Stockholm, received the original blueprints of six of the Moon mission containers from the Space Research Institute of Russia's Academy of Sciences. They offered an assignment to our team: to show the world a cutting-edge 2012 version of these pillars of human achievement in industrial design from the golden years of Russian space age! Here we present you the six containers as a pack, a combination of Russian precision with modern Scandinavian logotype work.
 
You can use them as you like, for free or commercial work. We hope that the designs give wings to your imagination and become the start for your beautiful virtual world.
